# Environments

## Development

Default local snapshot `hearth:v1:development`. The top-bar pill reads Development. Demo data is fictional CAD.

## Production

Second local snapshot `hearth:v1:production`. Empty until Jonathan starts it. The pill reads Production.

## Sheets (main branch only)

The Google development Sheet and production Sheet remain on `main`. This branch does not clasp-push and does not store Script IDs.

## Hosted household

The books are PostgreSQL. On the phone that is PGlite. The shared copy is the Supabase project `tykhocwacaxwquhynkok` (`https://tykhocwacaxwquhynkok.supabase.co`, region us-east-1). Phrase-join reads `household_snapshots` by invite phrase. A Netlify blob is not required. Development and production on a phone remain local keys. Default experiments to development.

To create the hosted tables, either:

1. Paste `supabase/migrations/001_hearth_books.sql` into the [SQL Editor](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/tykhocwacaxwquhynkok/sql/new) and Run, or
2. Put the real Postgres password (the value after `postgres:` in Connect — not `[YOUR-PASSWORD]`, not the API secret) in gitignored `.env` as `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD` and run `pnpm books:apply`.

Connect notes: database name is `postgres` (dashboard URIs that end in `/postgresz` are a typo). `db.tykhocwacaxwquhynkok.supabase.co` is IPv6-only. This environment applies through the session pooler `aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432` as `postgres.tykhocwacaxwquhynkok`. The phone app never receives that password.
